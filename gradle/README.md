### Summary of 4 scenarios related to using `implementation` and `api` for declaring module dependencies and importing projects

**Problem Statement** - In a multi-module Gradle project with "moduleA" and "moduleB," there is a need to understand how the use of implementation and api configurations in dependency declarations and project imports affects the visibility and accessibility of dependencies between these modules. The goal is to determine the appropriate use of these configurations to control the exposure of module-level dependencies while maintaining encapsulation of internal implementation details.

#### `implementation` in Module Dependency and `implementation(project(“:moduleA”))` in Project Import:
- If `moduleA` declares a dependency using `implementation`, it keeps that dependency as an internal implementation detail.
- When `moduleB` depends on `moduleA` using `implementation(project(“:moduleA”))`, it doesn’t see the `implementation`-scoped dependencies of `moduleA`.
- This provides encapsulation, and `moduleB` is not affected by `moduleA`’s internal dependencies.

#### `api` in Module Dependency and `implementation(project(“:moduleA”))` in Project Import:
- If `moduleA` declares a dependency using `api`, it exposes that dependency as part of its public API.
- When `moduleB` depends on `moduleA` using `implementation(project(“:moduleA”))`, it can see and use the `api`-scoped dependencies declared in `moduleA`.
- This allows `moduleB` to access `moduleA`’s public dependencies.

#### `implementation` in Module Dependency and `api(project(“:moduleA”))` in Project Import:
- If `moduleA` declares a dependency using `implementation`, it keeps that dependency as an internal implementation detail.
- When `moduleB` depends on `moduleA` using `api(project(“:moduleA”))`, it can see and use the `implementation`-scoped dependencies of `moduleA`.
- This is because `api` exposes the internal dependencies when `moduleA` is used as an `api`-scoped dependency in `moduleB`.

#### `api` in Module Dependency and `api(project(“:moduleA”))` in Project Import:
- If `moduleA` declares a dependency using `api`, it exposes that dependency as part of its public API.
- When `moduleB` depends on `moduleA` using `api(project(“:moduleA”))`, it can see and use the `api`-scoped dependencies declared in `moduleA`.
- This allows `moduleB` to access both the direct and transitive dependencies declared with `api` in `moduleA`.

The choice between `implementation` and `api` and how a module is imported using `implementation(project(“:moduleA”))` or `api(project(“:moduleA”))` depends on your project’s design and how you want to control the visibility and accessibility of dependencies between modules.
